# tapto-floppy
A ardunio based project to launch games on the TapTo platform via the contents of a floppy disc using the Adafruit Floppy FeatherWing.

## How It Works
The M4 microcontroller interfaces the the FeatherWing to connect a 34 pin floppy drive. The supporting libaries all the controller to read the discs from any 3.5 or 5.25 IBM PC compatible FAT floppy disc (so pretty much any 90s floppy drive will work).
